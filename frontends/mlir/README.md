# Auto-Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (AutoMLIR)

AutoMLIR (Auto-Multi-Level Intermediate Representation) is a partially auto-generated and extensible compiler infrastructure. AutoMLIR is heavily based on [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/) and [Hydride](https://github.com/AkashIwnK/Hydride). More information about AutoMLIR can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gSTDKX5lV3T6z5qcbdYe7TJTwbPlyYtIe7c9LALgRiI/edit?usp=sharing).

AutoMLIR currently uses MLIR release 15.x. We will keep this as up-to-date as possible.
