Warning: Not folding Func sobel_x along dimension x because there is vectorized access to that Func in that dimension and storage folding was not explicitly requested in the schedule. In previous versions of Halide this would have folded with factor 256. To restore the old behavior add sobel_x.fold_storage(x, 256) to your schedule.
