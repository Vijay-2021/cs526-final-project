# Hydride

Hydride is a retargetable synthesis-based compiler for modern tensor architectures.

Hydride has two major components:
- Compiler Generator - It is responsible for automatically generating target-agnostic DSL in Rosette for synthesis, LLVM IR extensions and legalization code.
- Code Synthesizer - It leverages Rosette to synthesize tensor and stencil computations using the DSL automatically generated by the Backend.

## Prerequisites

### Python
- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) > 3.0.

### Rosette
- Install [Racket](https://github.com/racket/racket) > 8.0.
- Install [Rosette](https://docs.racket-lang.org/rosette-guide/index.html) by running `raco pkg install rosette`.

### Z3
- Install [z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3):
    - MacOS: `brew install z3`
    - Linux example: `sudo apt-get install -y z3`

### LLVM
- Install [LLVM](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git):
    - Source: `git clone -b release/13.x https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git`

### Llvmlite
- Install [llvmlite](https://llvmlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html):
    - Install by running `pip install llvmlite`

## Directory Structure (WIP)
- `code-syntheizer` contains the experimental files for adding the notion of cost for different benchmark kernels and code for grammar generator.
- `compiler-generator` contains the custom compiler to generate target-agnostic DSL in Rosette for synthesis, LLVM IR extensions and legalization code.
- `rosette` tracks all the changes made to Rosette to synthesize code for Hydride.
- `benchmarks` contains the benchmarks synthesized for which Hydride generates vector instructions. It also contains Halide basline kernels.

## Targets Supported (WIP)
- x86 (AVX, SSE, VNNI)
- Hexagon (HVX)
